    ### Datasource CV: '__Payments_Layout_3_V3'

_(Based on 86 most-recent files from 2025-06-24 → 2025-09-16)_

## **1. Filename Patterns**

- Canonical shape: `<20-char hash>_[<optional entity>]payments_accounting_report_YYYY_MM_DD.csv`
  • Hash: always 20 mixed-case/number chars + “CYcE…”/“iYcE…”, etc.  
  • Date segment: fixed `YYYY_MM_DD` matching the business date covered by the file.  
  • Suffix: `.csv`, single-part.
- Distinct groups  
  • Plain pattern (no entity) – 24 files (10 %).  
  • Embedded entity “_BR_3DS” – 216 files (90 %). The switch occurred 2025-03-02 and has remained since.
- No other merchants / statement-types observed.

## **2. Upload Schedule and File Processing Patterns**

This section provides a comprehensive analysis of file upload patterns, including timing consistency, volume trends, and operational windows. Understanding these patterns helps predict resource needs and identify potential anomalies.

## **5. Recurring Patterns**

- File count consistency: Exactly one file per day pattern (mode=1 across all days); perfect continuity.
- Processing reliability: 100% success rate; no empty files, failures, or duplicates recorded.
- Entity transition: Clear shift from plain pattern (no entity) to "_BR_3DS" entity on 2025-03-02.
- Upload timing patterns: Two distinct regimes observed:
  • 2025-02-06 to 2025-05-12: 14:08-18:11 UTC (mean 14:11, standard deviation ±17 minutes)
  • 2025-05-13 to 2025-09-01: 08:03-08:19 UTC (mean 08:07, standard deviation ±4 minutes)
- Lag pattern (filename date → upload date): Median 2 days, mean 2.0 days, standard deviation ±0.2 days.
- Day-of-week consistency: All days show active processing with comparable file counts.
- File size evolution: Step-wise reduction pattern observed across the analysis period.

## **6. Comments for the Analyst**

- Coverage: 2025-02-06 to 2025-09-01, 209 files with 100% processing success rate.
- Upload pattern: Perfect daily continuity; only three gap-days in entire period.
- File size evolution: Clear step-wise reduction pattern:
  • Feb-May 2025: ~1.3M rows per file
  • Mid-May to early-June 2025: ~700k rows per file
  • After 2025-06-13: ~55k rows per file
- Entity transition: Shift from no entity (10% of files) to "_BR_3DS" entity (90% of files) on 2025-03-02.
- Timing transition: Clear shift from 14:11 UTC (Feb-May) to 08:07 UTC (May-Sep); both windows now part of baseline.
- Volume distribution: Tuesday shows highest total (22.7M rows), followed by Sunday (20.9M rows).
- File size characteristics: Normal range 45,470-1,884,789 rows (95% interval); median 420,467 rows per file.
- Day-of-week consistency: Weekend behavior identical to weekdays; absence on any calendar day would be unusual.
