## **1. Filename Patterns**

- Common structure: `DescoDevoluciones_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`
  • Static prefix (`DescoDevoluciones_`)  
  • Date stamp (ISO, 4-digit year – 2-digit month – 2-digit day)  
  • No part-numbering or additional suffixes observed.
- 100 % of files follow the pattern; no alternative spellings.
- Entities found in filenames: only the **file-date** (one per file).

## **2. Upload Schedule and File Processing Patterns**

This section provides a comprehensive analysis of file upload patterns, including timing consistency, volume trends, and operational windows. Understanding these patterns helps predict resource needs and identify potential anomalies.

- Very small files (≤100 rows) appear across weekdays but cluster in mid-March, late-May and mid-July.

## **5. Recurring Patterns**

- File count consistency: Predominantly one file per day pattern (mode=1 across all days).
- Processing reliability: 100% success rate; no failed or duplicate statuses in the sample.
- Small file occurrences: 20 files (6.0% of total) with <100 rows; clustered in specific periods:
  • Mid-March 2025
  • Late-May 2025
  • Mid-July to late-July 2025
- Multi-part upload events: 4 distinct dates with bulk uploads:
  • 2024-12-24: 10 files
  • 2025-04-08: 7 files (backfill for Apr-01 to Apr-07)
  • 2025-08-30: 4 files (backfill for Aug-26 to Aug-29)
  • 2025-02-19: 3 files
- Lag pattern (filename date → upload date):
  • Typical flow: Median 1 day
  • Overall pattern: Mean 1.6 days, standard deviation ±1.3 days
  • Bulk backfill days: Extended lags of 5-7 days
- Upload timing consistency: Stable window (15:00-18:00 UTC); mean 15:35 UTC, standard deviation ±45 minutes.
- Day-of-week consistency: All days show active processing; Tuesday shows highest variability.

## **6. Comments for the Analyst**

- Coverage: 2024-12-24 to 2025-09-01, 333 files with 100% processing success rate.
- Upload pattern: Daily uploads are the norm; only 5 isolated dates without uploads in entire period.
- Timing precision: Consistent upload window (15:00-16:30 UTC); uploads outside 14:00-18:00 UTC would be unusual.
- Volume distribution: Tuesday shows exceptional peak volume (895k rows); other days relatively consistent.
- File size characteristics: Normal range 557-11,657 rows (95% interval); median 5,929 rows per file.
- Data drift: Clear downward trend in file sizes after March 2025 (median ~8k → ~4.5k rows).
- Size expectations: Current normal range 3,000-11,300 rows; typical 4-7k rows depending on month.
- Processing anomalies: Small "micro" files (≤100 rows) account for 6% of history; appear in short bursts rather than randomly.
- Bulk upload pattern: Quarterly backfill events with multiple historical-date files; considered normal periodic occurrences.
