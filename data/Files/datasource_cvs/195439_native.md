## **5. Recurring Patterns**

- File consistency: One file per day pattern (mode=1 across all days); occasional outlier on Wednesday (max 34 files).
- Upload timing: Two distinct regimes observed:
  • 2024-11-06 → 2025-05-28: 22:30 ± 00:40 UTC
  • 2025-05-29 → 2025-09-01: 02:35 ± 00:25 UTC
- Lag (filename date → upload_at)
  • Consistent 3-day pattern: median 3 days (mean 3 ± 0.2).
  • Files consistently uploaded on D+3 from reference date.
- No empty files: 100% of files contain data (minimum 517 rows).
- Daily cadence: Consistent daily uploads with no gaps >1 day throughout analyzed period.
- File size transition: Files before May 29, 2025 averaged ~440k rows; after this date consistently ~1,200 rows.

## **6. Comments for the Analyst**

- Coverage: 2024-11-06 to 2025-09-01 uploads, 338 files with complete processing success (100%).
- Consistent daily pattern: One file per calendar day, uploaded consistently 3 days after reference date.
- Volume distribution: Relatively even across all days of week; Tuesday highest total (15.5M rows), Wednesday highest file count.
- Weekend processing: Active and substantial (Sat: 11.6M rows, Sun: 13.0M rows); matches weekday patterns.
- File size transition: Clear regime change on 2025-05-29:
  • Before: ~440k rows/file, uploaded ~22:30 UTC
  • After: ~1,200 rows/file, uploaded ~02:35 UTC
- Row count consistency: All files contain data (min 517 rows); no empty files observed.
- Timing reliability: Despite wide time window (00:29-22:41 UTC), most days show consistent upload timing within their regime.
