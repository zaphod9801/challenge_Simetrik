## **2. Upload Schedule and File Processing Patterns**

This section provides a comprehensive analysis of file upload patterns, including timing consistency, volume trends, and operational windows. Understanding these patterns helps predict resource needs and identify potential anomalies.

- **File Processing Statistics by Day**: The following table presents key metrics about file processing, including volume consistency (mean, median, mode) and variability (standard deviation):

- Row counts normally lie inside 10 k – 30 k regardless of weekday.

## **5. Recurring Patterns**

- Empty files: 7 files (2.9% of total); all confined to 2025-01 statement period, none after 2025-01-13.
- File count consistency: Predominantly one file per day (mode=1 across all days).
- Upload timing patterns: Two distinct regimes observed:
  • Feb-Jun 2025: 15:10 UTC ± 20 minutes
  • Jul-Aug 2025: 12:15 UTC ± 15 minutes
- Lag pattern (statement-date → upload-date):
  • Normal flow: Median 1 day, mean ~5 days, standard deviation ~8 days
  • Initial bulk load (2025-02-20/21): Extended lags of 34-37 days
- Day-of-week consistency: All days show active processing with comparable volumes (10k-30k rows).
- Bulk upload events: Two significant occurrences (2025-02-20: 6 files; 2025-02-21: 37 files) accounting for 18% of total files.

## **6. Comments for the Analyst**

- Coverage: 2025-01-01 to 2025-08-31, 243 files with 97.1% processing success rate.
- File pattern: One CSV per statement date with continuous daily coverage from 2025-02-01 onward.
- Timing transition: Clear shift from 15:xx UTC (Feb-Jun) to 12:xx UTC (Jul-Aug); both windows now part of baseline.
- Volume distribution: Friday shows highest total (890k rows), followed by Monday (649k rows).
- File size characteristics: Normal range 3,122-32,487 rows (95% interval); median 18,407 rows per file.
- Day-of-week consistency: All days (including weekends) show active processing with comparable volumes.
- Processing anomalies: Empty files (2.9%) confined to early January 2025; recurrence would be atypical (<1% since Feb).
- Upload reliability: No failures or duplicates recorded; consistent 97.1% "processed" status.
